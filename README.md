JAVA Project: Designed a Forex Trading application using Java with functionalities like maintaining trade life cycle, trade report window, handle trade order limit per day, display market data and total amount payable by the trader.

PURPOSE:
There is no central marketplace for currency exchange; trade is conducted over the counter. Foreign exchange is the exchange of one currency for another or the conversion of one currency into another currency. Foreign exchange transactions encompass everything from the conversion of currencies by a traveler at an airport kiosk to billion-dollar payments made by corporations, financial institutions and governments. 
Foreign exchange also refers to the global market where currencies are traded virtually around the clock. The forex market is open 24 hours a day, five days a week, except for holidays, and currencies are traded worldwide among the major financial centers. The forex is the largest market in the world in terms of the total cash value traded, and any person, firm or country may participate in this market. 
To ease the process, we provide the platform to book FX trade.
